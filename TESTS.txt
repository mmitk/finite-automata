The output.txt contains all of the output which explains which strings the accept and many example inputs 
and outputs that were accepted and rejected for every DFA and NFA.
The output.txt also shows the structure of the DFA's and NFA's in terms of their components
examples.py is where the examples are located

The following are the locations of the example DFA's and NFA's (example input and output in ouput.txt):

(1) The DFA that takes 'a' and 'b' and accepts input with 'aa' as a substring is located between 
    lines 11 and lines 37 in examples.py (aa_substring)
(2) DFA that takes '0' and '1' and accepts input where the number of '0' is a even is located
    between lines 41 and 75 of examples.py (multof2)
(3) DFA that takes '0' and '1' and accepts input where the number of '0' is a multiple of 3 is located
    between lines 80 and 114 of examples.py (multof3)
(4) The NFA which takes '0' and '1' and accepts input that ends in '01' is located 
    between lines 117 and 145 of examples.py (it is improperly named nfa_01_is_substring)
    Also there is the resulting DFA after conversion
(5) The NFA which takes '0' and '1' and accepts input that has a 1 at the second or third position from the end 
    is located between lines 167 and 218 of examples.py (it is improperly named nfa_01_is_substring)
    Also there is the resulting DFA after conversion
(6) The NFA example which takes 'a' and 'b' and accepts input with 'aa' as a substring is located between 
    lines 224 and lines 274 in examples.py (nfa_to_dfa_simple_test)
    Also there is the resulting DFA after conversion
(7) The NFA which takes 'a' and accepts input where the number of a's is even or divisible by 3 is
    located between lines 277 and 328 in examples.py
    Also there is the resulting DFA after conversion

The DFA class is located in dfa.py
the NFA class is located in nfa.py
exceptions and some utility functions are located in util.py
